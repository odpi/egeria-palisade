    "[ODPi Egeria](https://egeria.odpi.org/) is an open source project that provides open standards and implementation libraries to connect tools, catalogs and platforms together so they can share information about data and technology (called metadata).\n",

    "\n",
    "- **File Based Access Control** using a file's Access Control List (ACL)\n",

    "\n",
    "In all the examples in this notebook, the same user (Callie Quartile) is attempting to access the same file (employee records).  This file contains a mixture of fields that we want Callie to be allowed to read, and other fields that she should not be allowed to read. \n",
    "\n",
    "We showed that:\n",
    " * the simple approach using file-based access control can be used to control access to a whole file. If a subset of the file should only be visible, a new file needs to be created containing only that subset and the secured appropriately.  Although simple and widely supported, this appropach can lead to a proliferation of project-specific copies of the same data with potentially different standards of security implemented in each copy. The team needs to keep track of the copies and remove/archive them once each project is complete.\n",
    " \n",
    " * the content based approach uses metadata definitions to ensure all data of the same type is secured consistently.  With the approach, an individual sees the same data, irrespective of which copy they are looking at. This is valuable in a data lake environment where there are many copies of data optimized on different platforms for different processing.  However, for the use case we have been working with above, Callie actually needs project-specific views of the same data.\n",
    "   If a view-based access point is being used, these separate views can be defined.  While this avoids the duplication of data, it does require extra administration to manage the views.\n",
    " \n",
    " * the final approach with Palisade uses the context definition to restrict the access to data.  It is still based on metadata as in the content based approach, but the context identifer provided allows the view of data to be dynamically controlled by policy.  This avoids the technical administration and means that access policies can be changed immediately by the asset owners.  The asset owners are in full control.\n",
