ODPi Egeria lab tutorial 
---

The Egeria tutorials have now been deployed to Kubernetes.
It may take a minute or so for everything to start up.

Open your web browser and go to addressofmycluster:{{ .Values.service.nodeport.jupyter }} to
get started

You may need to contact your cluster admin, or read your cloud provider helptext to understand
the correct 'addressofmycluster' to use.

Please provide any feeback via a github issue at https://github.com/odpi/egeria or 
join us on slack via https://slack.odpi.org
